\section{Introduction}
For this TinLab project a project was designed to create a robot which can autonomously drive around and map its environment.
The technology used for such a bot could be used in a wide assortment of applications, such as in warehouses for 
the transport of goods, or for bots which can be used in a home environment to help with chores. This project can also serve as guideline 
for research of discovering enviroment that are inaccessible to humans.


% The robot designed for this project uses omniwheels, which are wheels that can move in any direction.


% In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), effective data visualization plays a vital role in enabling users 
% to interact with and control devices in real-time. This project focuses on the development of a dashboard to control an 
% omniwheel bot through MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), a lightweight messaging protocol commonly used in IoT systems. 
% The dashboard provides real-time updates, efficient communication, and security, making it suitable for environments 
% requiring both scalability and reliability. Through this system, users can monitor device status and send commands, thereby 
% achieving precise control.
