\textbf{MQTT Broker:} The system utilizes the Mosquitto broker for local testing and EMQX for scalability. 
Mosquitto is installed via the `sudo apt-get install mosquitto` command and is used to facilitate communication 
between the bot and the dashboard with low-latency message exchanges. For production-level scalability, EMQX 
ensures the broker can handle a larger number of devices and concurrent users.

\textbf{Frontend Dashboard:} The dashboard is built using React.js, with dynamic data visualization provided by Grafana. 
The dashboard subscribes to MQTT topics through MQTT.js, allowing for real-time updates on bot status, including metrics 
like speed, battery, and system diagnostics. The user interface includes interactive controls for bot movement and emergency 
stop functionalities. Additionally, system diagnostics and event logging are provided to help users track the bot's behavior 
and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
