\section{Results}
Extensive tests confirm the reliability and performance of the system. Real-time data transmission is achieved with an average latency of approximately 50ms, which is suitable for controlling devices in real-time applications. The system is capable of handling up to 100 simultaneous connections without any noticeable performance degradation. Stress testing demonstrates the system's ability to maintain message delivery with less than 0.5\% message loss when optimized with QoS settings. Additionally, the dashboard remains responsive and stable, with updates occurring at a smooth 30 frames per second (FPS), even under heavy data load. In the event of network disruptions, the MQTT system's persistent sessions and QoS 2 delivery mechanism ensure that messages are reliably delivered once the connection is restored.
