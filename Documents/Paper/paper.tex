\title{Dashboard Communication Through MQTT}
\author{Nitin Lala, Tigo Goes, Toine Steehouwer and Thomas van Vliet}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This paper discusses the development of an omniwheel bot that can drive autonomously or manually using a MQTT-based 
dashboard for real-time communication and control, and is able to map its enviroment on a map while doing so. 
The system was designed with IoT applications in mind, offering dynamic data updates, low-latency interactions, and 
secure connections. We address challenges such as system scalability, reliability in data transmission, and the efficient 
visualization of real-time information. The results demonstrate the ability of this system to manage and visualize data, with 
the flexibility for future enhancements and improvements in its architecture.

\section{Preliminary investigation}

\section{research questions}
Main question: 
How can visual mapping be implemnted on an omniwheel driven robot to map an environment?
Subquestions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can the real-time sensor values of the ultrasonic sensors be used to map the environment? 
    \item How can the map the location data be displayed remotely to the user in a clear way?

\end{itemize}
